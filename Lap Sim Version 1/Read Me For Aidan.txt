I've provided the following data over 1 endurance lap / 1 autocross lap:
- Max Motor Torque = 10 kW, 20 kW, and 40 kW
(I mainly did this so that you don't have to sift through 20,000 rows of data! But let me know if you want data for ALL 22 laps together)

The following parameters show up in each .csv file:
- v0	**SPEED**
- r0	**DISTANCE**
- t0	**TIME**
- w_wh
- w_m	**MOTOR ANGULAR VELOCITY, GIVEN IN RPM**
- T_m	**MOTOR TORQUE, GIVEN IN Nm**
- T_a
- F_trac
- F_drag
- F_RR
- F_net_tan
- a_tan0
- a_norm0
- P_battery	**BATTERY POWER, GIVEN IN kW**
- P_battery_OL	**BATTERY POWER AS ESTIMATED BY OPTIMUM LAP, GIVEN IN kW**
- P_battery_regen -- ignore this one, it's not accurate --
- Capacity
- Pack Current	**CURRENT RUNNING THROUGH BATTERY, GIVEN IN A**
- Energy Use	**CUMULATIVE CALCULATION OF ENERGY USE, GIVEN IN kWh, MULITPLY BY 22 TO GET TOTAL ENDURANCE ENERGY USE**
- Energy Use OL	**OPTIMUM LAP VERSION OF THE ABOVE**
- SoC Energy
- SoC Capacity
- Dissipated Power
- Battery Temp
- Heatsink Temp
- Max Values	**FIRST MAX VALUE IS ENERGY USAGE OVER 1 LAP IN kWh, SECOND IS MAX BATTERY POWER DURING LAP**

The following parameters were used:
- Car mass: 225 kg
- Rolling resistance coefficient: 0.01
- Inverter efficiency: 90%
- Max motor torque: 100 Nm
- Max motor power: (limits outlined above)
- Max motor rpm: 7600 rpm
- Motor efficiency: plotted graph from emrax 188 datasheet
